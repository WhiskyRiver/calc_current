# calc_current
This scripts is used to calculate the Landauer transmission and current density for a given molecule in a junction. The junction is assumed to be two dihydrogens.

This is a trimmed down version of the OG script as there was a lot of unused functions. They are not necessarily useless, but for the main purpose of the script, i.e. calculating the transmission and plotting the current density in a linear carbon chain, they were unneeded.
